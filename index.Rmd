# Hello!

I am a student pursuing my Master of IT in Business at Singapore Management University. Graduating with a bachelor in Mechanical Engineering, I am embarking on a new journey into the Data Science industry. As an aspiring Data Scientist, I want to utilize my analytical acumen to find solutions and translate them into actionable insights using data.
